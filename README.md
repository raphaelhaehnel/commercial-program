# Commercial Program

## Motivation
This program is a C++ application to manage commercial transactions.
It handles the interaction between buyers and products, and can keep the history of all the transactions. 

## Installation

The simplest way to build the code is by using Qt Creator. You can also download the Qt library manually from the website and edit the Makefile correctly.

## Usage

You can see below the main window of the program. You can either create a new project, or open an existing one.

After loading the data, or creating a new project, you should be able to perform some operations.
